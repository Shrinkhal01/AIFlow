> **A local developer workflow and project-tracking CLI for software engineers building with AI coding agents.**

---

## Quickstart

### 1. Install AIFlow
AIFlow compiles into a single, lightning-fast (<10ms) standalone binary:

```bash
# Clone and install globally
git clone https://github.com/Shrinkhal01/2026-workflow-projects.git aiflow
cd aiflow
cargo install --path .
```

### 2. Track Any Repository
Navigate to any project directory on your machine and let AIFlow guide your development:

```bash
# Step 1: Initialize AIFlow (interactively select your AI Subscription Stack)
cd ~/Projects/my-app
aiflow init

# Step 2: Check current development phase, tasks, test evidence, and Git status
aiflow status

# Step 3: View or switch active AI Subscription Stack anytime
aiflow stack
aiflow stack set claude-coder   # Switch to ChatGPT Planner + Claude Code Pro Coder

# Step 4: Run auto-detected test suite & cache pass/fail evidence
aiflow test run

# Step 5: Get immediate advice on the next action and assigned AI role
aiflow next

# Step 6: Multi-repository fleet dashboard across your whole workspace
aiflow projects
aiflow projects --all

# Step 7: Manage tasks in .aiflow/tasks.md
aiflow task list
aiflow task done TASK-01
aiflow task add "Implement auth middleware"

# Step 8: Advance phases once approved
aiflow phase complete

# Step 9: Verify repository consistency and health
aiflow doctor
```

## The Vision

In 2026, AI coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider) make generating code faster than ever. However, managing multiple repositories across different AI tools introduces **context fragmentation and process chaos**:

- *What project was I working on before switching contexts?*
- *What development phase is this repository in?*
- *Did the agent write code before architecture was approved?*
- *Are the tests passing? Has documentation fallen out of sync?*
- *What is the next logical action, and which AI model should I prompt for it?*

**AIFlow is NOT another AI coding agent.**  
AIFlow is the **developer's flight control system**—a blazing-fast, local-first CLI that tracks Git repositories, continuously derives project phase and readiness from Git, tests, docs, and artifacts, and guides the developer step-by-step through a disciplined development workflow.

## Core Philosophy

### 1. The Developer is the Final Decision Maker
AI agents propose and implement; the human developer steers, approves architecture, reviews code, and holds ultimate release authority.

### 2. Cognitive Role Specialization
Rather than using a single model for every task, AIFlow structures development around specialized roles:

```
                          ┌──────────────────────────┐
                          │     Human Developer      │
                          │   Requirements & Approvals│
                          └─────────────┬────────────┘
                                        │
                         ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
                         ▼                             ▼
              Claude (Architect)              Codex (Implementer)
              • System Design                 • Feature Implementation
              • Technical Tradeoffs           • Refactoring & Bug Fixes
              • Architecture Review           • Routine Development
                         │                             │
                         └──────────────┬──────────────┘
                                        ▼
                              Gemini (Review & Test)
                              • Adversarial Code Review
                              • Test Suite Generation
                              • Independent Verification
```

*(Note: Roles and provider bindings are fully customizable to prevent vendor lock-in.)*

### 3. Git as the Ground Truth
AIFlow is non-invasive and non-destructive. It reads Git branches (`phase/*`, `feat/*`), uncommitted changes, commit messages, and repository files to automatically infer state without locking your index or rewriting history.

### 4. Zero Cloud Overhead & Instant Startup
Built in Rust, AIFlow executes in `<15ms`, stores zero proprietary code in the cloud, sends no telemetry, and requires zero external runtimes (no Python virtual environments or Node installations needed).

## Pragmatic Workflow & Presets

To strike the ideal balance between deep architectural specifications and developer speed, AIFlow provides **Workflow Presets**, featuring the **5-Phase Workflow (`Specify` → `Plan` → `Build` → `Verify` → `Ship`) as the primary default**:

```
Specify ──> Plan ──> Build ──> Verify ──> Ship
```

| Phase | Scope & Objective | Primary Role & AI Agent | Human Approval Gate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **1. Specify** | Requirements, system architecture, scope & tradeoffs | **Architect (Claude + Human)** | **Required** (Spec signoff) |
| **2. Plan** | Milestone planning & granular task checklist (`tasks.md`) | **Architect (Claude)** | Optional |
| **3. Build** | Feature implementation, refactoring, code authoring | **Implementer (Codex / Cursor)** | Continuous |
| **4. Verify** | Test suite execution, adversarial review, edge-case audit | **Reviewer & Tester (Gemini)** | **Required** (Verification signoff) |
| **5. Ship** | Documentation updates, README refresh, git tagging | **Release Lead (Human)** | **Required** (Final release) |

*(Need more or fewer phases? Switch anytime with `--preset lean` for 4 phases or `--preset rigorous` for the 10-phase enterprise lifecycle).*
